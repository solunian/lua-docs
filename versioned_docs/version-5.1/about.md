## pleh

I thought using docusaurus was gonna be incredibly simple. Funny how their docs were kinda bad.
Or... maybe I was just too impatient to read it.

Hi, I made this. Why did I do this... that's a good question. I hope it's helpful!

## dev notes

Anyway! These docs were built with docusaurus and deployed with vercel.

I really only did this as a sidequest for making a game with l√∂ve, a lua game engine.
I just thought the documentation for the lua's std libs could be much better. I thought it
wouldn't take too long... but it took up three days-ish. Hmph. But, I mean for two of the
days, I had classes and did other life stuff, so some could say it was only two days of work.
Ah whatever.

Parsing html into markdown with regex is so cool. Haha...
